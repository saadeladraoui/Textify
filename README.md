# Textify - Text to Spotify Playlist

This application allows to transform a text to a spotify playlist.
The app is built with python and Spotipy (library to access Spotify API).

In the notebook you can find the functions used to accomplish this and some tests. 

Things to do : 
- Create a web app where the user can enter a text and generate the spotify playlist that the user can save in his library.
- Work on the search results, try NLP to extract context from the entered text and return results that match with the user entry.
